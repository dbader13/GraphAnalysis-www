    </h4>
    <h3>Scope and Goals:</h3>
    <p>Graph theoretic abstractions are extensively used to analyze massive temporal streaming data from socio-economic interactions, social networking sites, communication networks, scientific computing, and applications in national security.  Yet these problems pose serious challenges for parallel machines due to non-contiguous, concurrent accesses to global data structures with low degrees of locality. Few parallel graph algorithms outperform their best sequential implementation due to long memory latencies and high synchronization costs. In this minisymposium, we consider novel research on graph problems for real-world applications including the representation of these problems in the language of linear algebra.</p>

      <dt><strong>10:30-10:55 <a href="SIAM-AN09/01_Bader.pdf">Exascale Analytics of Massive Social Networks</a></strong></dt>
      <dd><em>David A. Bader</em>, Georgia Institute of Technology </dd>
      <dd>Combinatorial techniques are proving useful in solving real-world
challenges in traditional and emerging computational sciences
such as chemistry, biology, and medicine, as well as applications
in national security.  Emerging real-world applications can be
modeled using algorithms that process massive spatio-temporal
complex networks, such as power grid stability, inference of gene
function in protein interaction networks, and cancer research, as
well as homeland security and national defense.  In this talk we
focus on the analysis of massive social networks using graph
theoretic techniques.
Our experimental studies use real-world graph instances with
billions of elements and demonstrate superior performance on
highly parallel 20 systems such as the Cray XMT multithreaded
architecture and the Sun's Niagara 2 Maramba system. We will also
describe SNAP (Small- world Network Analysis and Partitioning),
an open-source graph framework that we have developed for the
exploration of massive complex networks and present new ideas on
the exploration of the dynamic structure of massive
spatio-temporal networks with billions of entities, such as
understanding the genesis and dissipation of communities,
allegiance switching, and source detection.</dd>

      <dt><strong>11:00-11:25 <a href="SIAM-AN09/02_Kepner.pdf">Graph Detection Theory for Power Law Graphs</a></strong></dt>
      <dd><em>Jeremy Kepner</em>, Massachusetts Institute of Technology </dd>
      <dd><!-- Detecting items of interest from the patterns of interaction in
  large graphs is the goal many graph analysis techniques.  The
  basis of detection theory is computing the probability of a
  "signature" with respect to a model of the "background" data.
  Hidden Markov Models represent one possible signature model for
  patterns of interacation in a graph.  Likewise, Kronecker
  graphs are one possible background model for graphs.  Combining
  these models results in a filter that can be used compute the
  probability that a given graph contains a particular signature. --></dd>
      <dt><strong>11:30-11:55 <a href="SIAM-AN09/03_Buluc.pdf">Parallel Combinatorial BLAS and Applications in Graph   Computation</a></strong></dt>
      <dd><em> Aydin Buluc</em> and John R.   Gilbert, University of California, Santa Barbara </dd>
      <dd>Graph computations are difficult to parallelize using traditional
approaches due to their irregular nature and low operational
intensity. Many graph computations, however, contain sufficient
coarse grained parallelism that can be uncovered by using the
right set of abstractions. We have been developing a parallel
combinatorial BLAS that consists of a small but powerful set of
linear algebra primitives. We will explain our software design
philosophy and report on the initial results with our reference
implementation.

      <dt><strong> 12:00-12:25 <a href="SIAM-AN09/04_Madduri.pdf">Scaling up Graph   Algorithms on Emerging Multicore Systems</a></strong></dt>
      <dd><em>Kamesh Madduri</em>, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory </dd>
      <dd>Graph algorithms on sparse random networks typically suffer a
3-5X drop in performance when their memory footprint gets larger
than the last-level cache on current systems. We attempt to
ameliorate this drop for breadth-first search, and present
several strategies to limit the number of non-contiguous memory
references incurred in graph traversal. We extend these ideas to
improve parallel scaling on cache-based multicore systems, by
utilizing the shared and private caches more effectively, and by
reducing synchronization overhead. We observe that the strategies
discussed for breadth-first search are applicable to a large
class of graph algorithms, and present another case study of a
cache-aware parallel betweenness centrality algorithm for
small-world networks.</dd>

    <dl>
      <dt><strong>4:00-4:25 <a href="SIAM-AN09/05_Sears.pdf">Parallel Implementation of Tensor Decompositions for Large Data   Analysis</a></strong></dt>
      <dd><em>Mark P. Sears</em>, Brett W. Bader, and Tammy Kolda, Sandia National   Laboratories </dd>
      <dd>Large data sets can often be mapped into multidimensional arrays,
which we call tensors; the resulting tensor is usually extremely
sparse. Similar to the SVD decomposition of a matrix there are a
number of proposed tensor representations in terms of
factors. This talk will describe serial and parallel
implementations of several algorithms for tensor analysis, in
particular algorithms which compute PARAFAC and Tucker
representations of tensors. We will discuss previous and
potential applications of these representations.</dd>
      <dt><strong> 4:30-4:55 <a href="SIAM-AN09/06_Mahoney.pdf">Novel Graph Algorithms   for Structure Extraction from Informatics Networks</a></strong></dt>
      <dd><em>Michael Mahoney</em>, Stanford University </dd>
      <dd>Large informatics graphs such as large social and information
networks that are increasingly common in Internet and
high-performance computing applications have surprising complex
and subtle structural and dynamic properties.  For instance,
their size alone, which can be in the millions or billions or
more of nodes, immediately renders many traditional algorithmic
tools unusable.  In addition, their extreme sparsity and
adversarial noise properties render many existing statistical
tools inappropriate.  Finally, due to their heavy-tailed
properties, these networks are not meaningfully low-dimensional
nor are they meaningfully high-dimensional, and thus methods that
explicitly or implicitly rely on either of those common
assumptions have severe limitations.  I will describe
recently-developed algorithms that begin to deal with some of
these problems and that allow the analyst to probe in very fine
ways nontrivial structural properties of extremely large
informatics networks.  Examples of these algorithms include
generalizations of spectral graph partitioning to find good cuts
that are near a specified node, efficient methods to compute
graph resistances that can be used to identify disproportionately
important or influential nodes, graph partitioning algorithms
that interpolate between spectral and flow-based algorithms, and
heuristics to characterize the large-scale clustering structure
of large networks.</dd>
      <dt><strong> 5:00-5:25 <a href="SIAM-AN09/07_Chavarria.pdf">Scalable &amp; Efficient   Parallelization of Graph Methods for Boolean Satisfiability and Power Grid   Analysis on the Cray XMT</a></strong></dt>
      <dd><em>Daniel Chavarria</em>, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory </dd>
      <dd>Graph-based algorithms have a broad applicability to many
different areas of science and technology.  Unfortunately,
executing them efficiently for large-scale graphs requires a
significant time and resource investment on traditional HPC
systems.  The Cray XMT multithreaded architecture provides
specialized hardware designed for the efficient parallel
execution of highly irregular codes, such as those derived from
graph algorithms.  This presentation will discuss our experiences
in implementing two graph-based algorithms on the Cray XMT
system: a Boolean satisfiability solver based on parallel Survey
Propagation and an exact, edge-based, weighted Betweenness
Centrality calculation applied to power grid analysis.</dd>

      <dt><strong>10:30-10:55 <a href="SIAM-AN09/08_Bhowmick.pdf">Detecting Community Structure in Dynamic   Networks</a></strong></dt>
      <dd><em>Sanjukta Bhowmick</em>, Shweta Bansal, Kelly Fermoyle, and Padma   Raghavan, Pennsylvania State University </dd>
      <dd>Community structure detection in networks has important
applications in understanding social structures, spread of
epidemics, etc. However most algorithms for detecting
communities (defined as tightly connected group of nodes) are
applicable only to a static network with fixed nodes and edges.
In reality, social networks are dynamic and the connections
change with time.  In this talk, we present an algorithm that can
dynamically detect the change in communities as the network
evolves over time steps.</dd>
      <dt><strong>11:00-11:25 <a href="SIAM-AN09/09_Vullikanti.pdf">Structure of Large Scale Social Contact Graphs and its   Effect on Epidemics</a></strong></dt>
      <dd><em>Anil Vullikanti</em>, Virginia Polytechnic Institute &amp; State   University </dd>
      <dd>In recent years, there has been a lot of interest in studying the
spread of epidemics on social contact graphs. We discuss
important structural properties of a class of large scale
synthetic social contact graphs.  We discuss what effect the
underlying graph structure has on the disease dynamics, and how
these structural properties can be used in designing effective
interventions for epidemics (e.g., whom to vaccinate), which is
an important public health issue.</dd>
      <dt><strong>11:30-11:55 High Performance Computing for Large Graph   Problems</strong></dt>
      <dd><em>Bruce Hendrickson</em> and Jonathan Berry, Sandia National Laboratories </dd>
      <dd>Graph abstractions have long been central to sparse matrices,
parallel computing, chemistry, logistics and many other areas.
But recent years have witnessed a further broadening of graph
models to represent entities and relationships in ecology, social
science, text analysis and other fields.  There is a growing need
for high performance graph algorithms to address problems in
which the data is very large and/or timely response is important.
For complex graphs, algorithms often exhibit very poor locality,
and so cache-based architectures, and message-passing programming
models deliver disappointing performance.  In this talk, I will
discuss our exploration of non-traditional architectures and
programming models for graph algorithms, placing this work in the
larger context of ongoing changes within the high performance
computing universe.</dd>
      <dt><strong>12:00-12:25 Anatomy of a Distributed Graph</strong></dt>
      <dd><em>Andrew Lumsdaine</em>, Douglas Gregor, and Nick Edmonds, Indiana   University</dd>
      <dd>For the large-scale matrix and vector data structures used in
scientific computing the data distribution process has become
relatively well understood.  However, the increasing prominence
of large-scale graph-based problems has magnified the importance
of effective computation with distributed graph structures.
Based on our experience with the Parallel Boost Graph Library, we
present an overview of the unique characteristics of distributed
graph data structures and the impact of these characteristics on
application development and performance.
