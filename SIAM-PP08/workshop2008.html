  <h3>SIAM PP08 Workshop for HPC on Large Graphs</h3>
  
    <h4 align="center">
      The Rennaissance Atlanta Hotel Downtown<br />
      Atlanta, GA<br /> 
      <br />
    12-14 March 2008<br />
    </h4>
    <h3>Scope and Goals:</h3>
    <p>Graphs are a fundamental representation of information that spans the widest possible range of computing
applications. They are particularly important to computational biology, web search, and knowledge
discovery. As the sizes of the graphs increase, the need to apply High Performance Computing (HPC) to
solve these problems is growing dramatically. This workshop represents a unique opportunity for the
community of researchers in this field and focus on the technical issues associated with applying HPC to
large graph problems. The workshop will feature several invited speakers drawn from the leaders in this
new and rapidly growing field.</p>
    <h3>Location:</h3>

    <span class="style6">Thursday, March 13</span></span>
    <dl>
          <dt><strong>1:30-1:55 <a href="Kepner.pdf">Analytic Theory of Power Law Graphs</a></strong> </dt>
      <dd><span class="style3"><em>Jeremy Kepner</em>, Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span></dd>
          <dd>An analytical theory of power law graphs is presented based on the
            Kronecker graph generation technique.  The analysis uses Kronecker
            exponentials of complete bipartite graphs to formulate the
            sub-structure of such graphs.  This allows various high level quantities
            (e.g. degree distribution, betweenness centrality, diameter,
            eigenvalues, and isoparametric ratio) to be computed directly from the
            model parameters.  The implications of this work on ``clustering'' and
            ``dendragram'' heuristics are also discussed. </dd>
          <dt><strong>2:00-2:25 <a href="Bader.pdf">Parallel Algorithms for Small-world Network Analysis and   Partitioning</a></strong> </dt>
      <dd><span class="style3"><em>David A. Bader</em>, Georgia Institute of Technology </span></dd>
           <dd>	We present SNAP, a parallel library for exploratory analysis and
            partitioning of small-world networks. SNAP includes fast, parallel
            implementations of fundamental graph-theoretic kernels and topological
            analysis metrics (e.g., breadth-first search, connected components,
            betweenness centrality), as well as novel community structure detection
            algorithms. In the talk, we highlight algorithmic details and
            optimizations to achieve scalable parallel performance on small-world
            graph instances.</dd>
          <dt><strong>2:30-2:55 <a href="Berry.pdf">The MultiThreaded Graph Library</a></strong> </dt>
  <dd><span class="style3"><em>Jonathan Berry</em>, Sandia National Laboratories</span><br />
            The MultiThreaded Graph Library (MTGL) is a set of open-source codes for
            graph algorithms that target emerging massively multithreaded
            architectures.  This library is based upon a kernel of the Boost Graph
            Library, though it does not require Boost.
            
            MTGL codes run on serial workstations, and can run on the Cray MTA/XMT
            supercomputers.  Much of the detail inherent in the programming model of
      the latter machines is abstracted away from the application programmer.</dd>
          <dt><strong>3:00-3:25 <a href="Dunlavy.pdf">Tensor Decompositions for Analyzing Multi-Link   Graphs</a></strong> </dt>
  <dd><span class="style3"><em>Danny Dunlavy</em>, Tammy Kolda, and Philip Kegelmeyer, Sandia National   Laboratories</span><br />
            Link analysis of data represented by a graph typically focuses on a
            single type of connection. However, often we want to analyze data that
            has multiple linkages between objects. The goal of this talk is to show
            that tensors and their decompositions provide a set of tools for
            multi-link analysis. We provide examples of how tensors can be used to
            understand the structure of document spaces and define similarities
      based on multiple linkages.</dd>

          <dt><strong>10:00-10:25 <a href="Buluc.pdf">Parallel Primitives for Computation with Large   Graphs</a></strong> </dt>
    <dd><span class="style3"><em> Aydin Buluc</em> and John R.   Gilbert, University of California, Santa Barbara </span><br />
          Large combinatorial graphs appear in many applications of
high-performance computing, including computational biology,
informatics, analytics, web search, dynamical systems, and sparse matrix
methods.  High-performance combinatorial computing is much less well
understood than high-performance numerical computing, where there are
standard algorithmic primitives and a deep understanding of effective
mappings of problems to computer architectures.  Here we describe the
usage and implementation of sparse generalized matrix-matrix
multiplication as a primitive operation for high-performance computing
on large graphs.</dd>
          <dt><strong>10:30-10:55 <a href="Leskovic.pdf">Kronecker Graphs</a></strong> </dt>
    <dd><span class="style3"><em>Jure Leskovec</em>, Carnegie Mellon University </span><br />
          Given a large, real graph, how can we generate a synthetic graph that is
similar, i.e., it has similar degree distribution, diameter, spectrum,
etc.? I will introduce &quot;Kronecker graphs&quot; model, which naturally
generates graphs with above properties, and present a fast and scalable
algorithm for fitting Kronecker model to real networks. Experiments on
large real networks show that Kronecker mimics well the patterns found
in target graphs. Once fitted, the model can be used for anonymization,
extrapolations, and graph summarization.</dd>
          <dt><strong>11:00-11:25 <a href="Madduri.pdf">High Performance Combinatorial Techniques for Processing   Dynamic Interaction Networks</a></strong> </dt>
    <dd><span class="style3"><em>Kamesh Madduri</em>, Georgia Institute of Technology </span><br />
          Graph abstractions are extensively used to model temporal data streams
from socio-economic interactions, the world-wide web, and communication
networks. For tractable analysis of massive temporal data sets, we
require holistic schemes that couple HPC techniques, dynamic graph
algorithms, and social network analysis kernels. In this talk, we
present a computational framework for the topological analysis of
dynamic networks: we experiment with several graph representations,
identify key analysis kernels to be optimized, and discuss parallel
algorithms for large-scale graph analysis.</dd>
          <dt><strong>11:30-11:55 <a href="Robinson.pdf">Array Based Betweenness Centrality</a></strong> </dt>
  <dd><span class="style3"><em>Eric Robinson</em>, Northeastern University </span><br />
            The betweenness centrality metric measures the importance of a node in a

graph by examining the number of shortest paths through it.
A natural translation of a sequential BC algorithm using linear
algebraic
notation is shown.  A batching parameter shifts this algorithm between<em>O(E)</em> and <em>O(V^2)</em> space, possibly providing constant speedup for small

batch values.  When implemented in pMatlab, both sequential and parallel
algorithms
are shown to have reasonable performance compared to their C
counterparts.<br />
